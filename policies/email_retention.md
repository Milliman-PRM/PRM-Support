# Email Retention Policy


The general policy for email retention for PRM Support is to retain emails for 2 years. Any ticket with a resolved date older than 2 years will be removed via the Jira Automation plugin, which will run a search daily.


If a ticket is escalated to a consultant, the consultant is responsible for retention of the email in accordance with PRMs QRM policy. It will otherwise be removed after 2 years in accordance with PRM Support policy.


If an unrelated/mistake email is sent to PRM Support, the service desk administrator will purge the email immediately.
