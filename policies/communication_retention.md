# Communication Retention Policy


The general policy for communication retention for PRM Support is to retain communications for 2 years. Any ticket with a resolved date older than 2 years will be removed via the Jira Automation plugin, which will run a search daily.


If a ticket is escalated to a consultant, the consultant is responsible for retention of the communication in accordance with PRMs QRM policy. It will otherwise be removed after 2 years in accordance with PRM Support policy.


If an unrelated/mistake communication is sent to PRM Support, the service desk administrator will purge the communication and any associated tickets immediately.
