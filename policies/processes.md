## PRM Support Processes
Help scout is used to triage and respond to any support emails. This consists of emails to prm.support@milliman.com and map.support@milliman.com

### Help Scout Processes
- Assign an issue as soon as it comes in. This can be to yourself or whoever is the best person to handle the request. Do not let issues linger in Unassigned.
- If the reported issue warrants a github issue, then do the following:
  - Tag the issue in helpscout with the github number issue using the following syntax: `gh-issue-###`
  - At the bottom of the github issue, leave a note that indicates the help scout issue it is related to
- If the issue falls into one of the workflows listed in help scout, use that functionality and leave a note for any clarifications as you see fit.
- Leave issues in "pending" status until the issue reported has been complete. 
- Once an issue has been handled, change the status to "closed".
